4. Replace works with column values also. here capital contains country name columns's value (Mexico City contains Mexico)
Query: SELECT name,replace(capital,name,'') FROM world WHERE 
capital LIKE concat(name,"_%");

5.CASE WHEN condition1 THEN value1 
       WHEN condition2 THEN value2  
              ELSE def_value 
	        END 

Query: SELECT name, population
      ,CASE WHEN population<1000000
       THEN 'small'
       WHEN population<10000000 
	           THEN 'medium'
                   ELSE 'large'
                   END
       	           FROM bbc

6. Null is not equal to any other null or to anything else. In left join - you have to use rightTable_col is null to know which fields are not present in
inner join

7. In many-to-many table design we need a junction table to hold the primary keys of two table we are trying to relate

8. We can have a table with only foreign key and no primary key, in case of one to one table design 

9. Union -gives distinct column elements of two tables. Union All - gives all column elements between two tables.
   Intersect between two tables will give you values that occur in both the tables.
   Intersect is not present in MySql - use "IN" or "Exists" clause (inefficient) with inner select query.
