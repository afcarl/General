Whiskey Tavern.<br/>Want to pregame in a cram packed bar (on weekend)? Whiskey Tavern.<br/>Want to sing to early 2000s-2010s songs? Whiskey Tavern.<br/><br/>I discovered this place with my friend back in October and ever since had to get one of their UFO pumpkin beers every week (pumpkin beer with a cinnamon rim). There is a special going on every night, but my favorite has to be Taco Tuesday where it's $7 for 3 tacos. Did I mention they have flaming BBCs when you order a pickle-back? Yeah, that might shock you the first time you go, but you'll get use to it real soon, haha. That's how I know I've become desensitized to the tavern...when you bring your friends for the first time and they start freaking out over a flaming big black cock and you think it's normal!<br/><br/>This place get PACKED on the weekends starting around 10pm, so I suggest going on a weekday when it's more relaxed and just enjoy the atmosphere that is the Whiskey Tavern.\",\n",
       " \"I stumbled upon this place during a photography outing. The bar had no problems accommodating my group of 16, even though one of their tables had already been reserved.

       " \"Full disclosure: I'm not a bar sort of girl. Or a pub, as the Whiskey Tavern is classified.<br/><br/>But if you're with close friends, are in a good mood and want to stay that way, and are emotionally prepared to have drinks and other unidentified liquids spilled on you, this is the place.<br/><br/>If you had a bad day at work and are one to ruminate, plus you're with a group that has someone who's an absolute downer and just stood there the entire time, it's probably going to be a shitty visit. <br/><br/>Drinks were solid, bathroom was a little cramped but clean, and people are drunkenly polite. It's super crowded on the inside, so be prepared and don't bring your bag from work (nor dress like you just finished your day at the Bloomberg terminal, like I did [bad idea]). It also doesn't seem like it would have a lot of room for grub, although the reviews seem to have lots of people trying out the food (??). <br/><br/>One thing I noticed was that the crowd skewed a tad older - like, late twenties, early thirties which, in itself, is not a bad thing at all. However, if you're trying to cling to your youth like I am, it was a rude awakening to hear Taylor Swift (not my cup of tea, fyi) mixed with NWA. However, it's still pretty fun...but again, my time was rough because I wasn't emotionally prepared nor dressed appropriately.\",\n",
       " \"Last Irish bar in Chinatown! Surrounded by Chinese and Vietnamese restaurants and mani pedi, this bar is really cool. Irish/American atmosphere with pop music, nice crowd, and a great selection of beers, whiskers, and bites. Fairly cheap, there are specials almost every week and weekend, like taco Tuesdays, Wednesday sliders, etc.<br/>I came here with four friends few evenings ago, and we had a blast. It's 5 minutes walk from city hall and 5 minutes from Canal Street. Perfect spot for afterwork drinks.\",\n",
       " \"Finally made it here after much urging by friends! On this particular Friday night, there were 3 different birthday parties going on. While this made for a popping party, it also created a lot of noise and made the place feel like it was best for large groups. Indeed, when we looked around, it seemed like most people were with at least 3-4 friends if not larger. I ordered the Baxter St. Lemonade-it was delicious and STRONG. I was really surprised at how far just that one drink got me. <br/><br/>It was definitely crowded, but we had no problem getting in and there was definitely space to stand around. I was a fan of the music they played-slightly older pop songs but great choices that really got the beat going. <br/><br/>When I come back, I will definitely bring a bigger group of friends (was just with one other person tonight). Seems like this place is great for celebrations and late night drinking. Come here to low-key party and drink, but don't expect to be able to hold intimate conversations as it is quite loud! Probably most fun after you are already slightly tipsy. :)\",\n",

Welcome relief from the way \"Tiny\\'s &amp; the bar upstairs\" treated us! <br/><br/>Despite being packed, they seated us at a reserved table with the sole request that we let the table go 10 mins before the folks who reserved it got there. And we stuck to our word! <br/><br/>The jalape\\xc3\\xb1o poppers were nice, and the fried pickles were unique, though I can\\'t say I took a fancy to them.

       " \"A previous reviewer already wrote a similar review to the one that I was planning, but I'll just echo it in support for this established. Wow. This. Place. Was. Awesome.<br/><br/>I went here after going to Apotheke. My friend and I wanted to find a second bar to go to in Chinatown, and given that we were both Chinatown newbies, I went to Yelp for a short invesitgation. This place had rave reviews, so off we went.<br/><br/>I have to say, this place was probably the antithesis of Apotheke, but they were both incredible in their own way. I think it's important to say that prior to coming to Whiskey Tavern, I had only recently discovered pickle backs. The night before, I saw a couple people doing them at a different bar, and inquired as to what type of shots they were doing. After they explained, I tried one - and loved it. So what a coincidence then, that my search on Yelp revealed that this place is FAMOUS for not only pickle backs, but their SPICY backs. And oh my god, for something so simple, they are just so great. <br/><br/>This place was packed to the brim which I'd usually hate, but at a place like this, that's how it should be. My friend and I wiggled out way up to the front, at which point I asked her if she'd heard of pickle backs. Her reply was no, however she said that she had a weird love of pickle juice, so she was completely game. We ordered two spicy backs, and they were heavenly. I'm not sure how many we ordered, but at one point the bartender did one with us too. It was wild but not too wild. Everything about this place is awesome.\",\n",

As soon as we walked in it was pretty crowded and even though all the bartenders were busy they stopped to say hello and introduce themselves. What!!!!!! Can that be? Nice people in NY? Oh yes my friends, we found some. After awhile we were able to snag seats at the bar where there bartender proceeded to have a genuine conversation with us about our trip and what we had liked about it so far. It was awesome!

Because we came in our wedding clothes, she surprised us with some shots of cinnamon whiskey and a little Hostess chocolate cake while the bar played the wedding song.

There are storage compartments under the booths which is great until annoying patrons come by every two minutes asking if they can store/retrieve/rummage through their purse, requiring that you stop your merrymaking and stand up in a tiny booth with your knees bent and weight shifted in an awkward position. I came here with a friend and had one drink. We left immediately afterwards because really, who can stand for that nonsense. <br/><br/>I will say that our waitress did a good job and was quick with the drinks and very friendly.
